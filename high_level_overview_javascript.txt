###### Overview of Javascript ############

1. Javascript is a high level, prototype-based, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time
compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first class functions
and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

Terminology:

1. High level:
	Such programming languages don't make developers manage system resources as those operations are
	abstracted away.

2. Garbage-collected:
	Javascript has algorithms inside the javascript engine which removes old, unused objects
	from memory in order to not clog it up with unnecessary stuff.

3. Interpreted or Just-in-time compiled:
	Javascript is compiled from human-readable language to machine code. It happens inside the
	javascript engine.

4. Multi-paradigm:
	An approach of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique

	a. Procedural programming
	b. Object-oriented programming
	c. Functional programming

	Or it can be divided into 2 types:

	a. Imperative
	b. Declarative

5. Prototype-based object-oriented:
	Every created object inherits methods from its prototype using prototypal inheritance.

6. First-class functions:
	It means functions can be treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions
	and return them from functions.

7. Dynamically-typed:
	It means there are no datatype definitions. Types become known at runtime and the datatype
	of variable is automatically changed.

########### The Javascript Engine and Runtime ##########

Javascript Engine:

1. It is a program that executes javascript code. Every browser has its own javascript engine and
the most well-known one is Google Chrome's V8 Engine used in Node.js also.

2. A javascript engine has 2 components the callstack and the heap.

3. The callstack is where the code is executed using the execution contexts.

4. Heap is the unstructured memory pool which stores all the objects that our application
   needs.

5. As a computer's processor understands only 0s and 1s the javascript code is first converted to 
   binary code using compilation or interpretation

6. Compilation:
	Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can
	be executed by a computer.

7. Interpretation:
	Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line.

8. Just-In-Time compilation:
	Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately. The step in
	which machine code is written to a binary file is skipped and binary code is executed
	immediately.

9. Javascript is a just-in-time compiled language.

10. Steps in which javascript is executed:
	a. Parsing
	b. Compilation
	c. Execution
	d. Optimization

	d, b, c steps keep running in loops till the code is executed entirely.

11. Web APIs are accessible using the global window object.

12. Parts of the Javascript Runtime:
	a. JS Engine - Heap, Callstack
	b. Web APIs - DOM, fetch API, timers
	c. Callback queue - click events, timer callbacks, data callbacks

13. The functions in callback queue are executed when the callstack becomes empty

14. Node.js runtime contains the same parts as a Javascript runtime but it does not
	have the web APIs instead it has C++ bindings & threadpool.


########## Execution contexts and the call stack #########

What is an execution context ? (or how the call stack works ?)

1. After the compilation of code is done, a global execution context is created for the
	top level code and top level code is basically all the code that is not inside the
	function.

2. Top level code is basically expressions and function declarations but the code inside
	the function is executed when called.

3. Execution context is an environment where a piece of javascript is executed. It stores
	all the information for some code to be executed.

4. In any javascript project only 1 global execution context (default context) is created.

5. After creation of global execution context, execution of top level code inside it happens.

6. After the top level code is executed, functions start to execute. For every function to be
	executed a execution context is created for that function and for methods in js objects.
	All these execution contexts together make up the call stack.

7. When functions are done executing, the JS engine waits for callback functions to arrive so
	that it can execute these.

What's inside the execution context ?

1. Variable Environment:
	The first thing inside the execution context is the variable environment. It stores all
	the variables and function declarations are stored and there is a special arguments object.
	This object contains all the arguments that were passed to the function.

2. A function can access variables outside the function using the scope chain.

3. Each context also gets a this keyword.

4. Above 3 parts are generated during the creation phase right before execution.

5. Execution contexts of arrow functions don't get this keyword and arguments object. Instead
	they can use the arguments object and the this keyword from their closest parent regular function.

How will the JS engine keep track of the order in which functions were called ? And how will it
know where it currently is in the execution ?

1. Call Stack:
	It is the place where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other to keep track
	of where we are in the execution.


######### Scope and scope chain ############

1. Execution context:
	The execution context contains 3 parts variable environment, scope chain and this keyword.

2. Scoping: How our variables are organized and accessed. "Where do variables live ?" or "Where can we 
	access our variables and where not ?".

3. Lexical scoping: It means that the way variables are organized and accessed are controlled by
	placement of functions and of blocks in the programs code.
	Eg. A function that is inside another function has access to the variables of the parent function.

4. Scope: Space or environment in which a certain variable is declared (variable environment in case
	of functions). There is global scope, function scope and block scope.

5. Scope and variable environment is same in the case of functions.

6. Scope of a variable: Region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed.

7. The 3 different types of scope:
	a. Global scope
	b. Function scope
	c. Block scope (ES6)

Scope is the place where the variables are declared. Functions also are stored in variables.

Global scope:
This for top level code or for all variables and functions declared outside of any block
or function. These variables are accessible everywhere in our program, in all functions and 
all blocks.

Function scope:
Each and every function creates a scope and the variables inside are accessible inside that function.
It is called local scope. Outside the function the variables inside are not accessible. It is technically
same as the variable environment. Reference error is thrown if tried to access variable present inside function.

Block scope:
1. Previously in ES5 only function and global scopes were present but starting from ES6 module we have
block scope. Blocks also create scopes and with blocks we mean everything between curly braces such
as a block of if statement or for loop. Variables inside that block are accessible in that block only
and not outside the block.

2. The big difference between function and block scope. Block scopes only apply to variables declared
with "let" and "const". "let" and "const" are block scoped whereas "var" is scoped to the function or the global
scope.

3. Function declarations are also block scoped (only in strict mode). Otherwise they are global scoped.

4. Scope chain:

const myName = "Jonas";

function first() {
	const age = 30;

	if (age >= 30) {
		const decade = 3; 
		var millinial = true;
	}

	function second() {
		const job = "teacher";

		console.log(`${myName} is a ${age}-old ${job}`);
		// Jonas is a 30-old teacher
	}

	second();
}

first();

let and const are block scoped but var is function scoped. Inner scopes can access variables from the
outer scopes.

5. Scope chain vs call stack:

=> Call stack is the order in which functions were called.
	Scope is the order in which functions are written.

=> Scope chain is equal to adding together all the variable environments of all the parent scopes.
	Scope chain is built behind the scenes by the JS engine.

=> Variable lookup:
	When a variable is not in the current scope, the engine looks up in the scope chain until it finds
	the variable its looking for. This is called variable lookup.

=> Lexical scoping:
	It determines the access to variables and functions written within a program.

=> Scope chain is nothing to do with the order of the function calls.


########## Variable Environment, Hoisting and the temporal dead zone (TDZ) ###########

1. Lets take a closer look at the variable environment.

2. Hoisting:
		It makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they
	are actually declared. "Variables are lifted to the top of their scope". Before execution,
	code is scanned for variable declarations and for each variable a new property is created
	in the variable environment object.

3. Hoisting works differently for different variable types:

	a. Function declarations:
			These are hoisted with initial value as the function and it is block scoped (in strict mode only).
			In practice, we can use function declarations before they are actually declared in the code.

	b. var variables:
			These are hoisted with initial value as undefined and they are function scoped. var variables
			give undefined before the declaration without throwing any errors.

	c. let and const variables:
			let and const variables are not hoisted as they are in the temporal dead zone (TDZ). TDZ is the region
			between the start of the scope and the place where the variables are declared. let and const are block
			scoped.

	d. Function expressions and arrow functions:
			Hoisting for these depends on using var, let or const for storing the expressions. We cannot use them
			before we write them in the code unlike function declarations.

3. Temporal Dead Zone:
	=> This exists so that it is easier to avoid and catch errors. Accessing variables before declaration
	is bad practice and should be avoided.

	=> Makes const variables work as they should. They shouldn't be re-assigned and should be initialized
		when they are declared.

4. Why Hoisting ?
	=> Makes code more readable.
	=> Helps in using functions before actual declaration.

######## this keyword ##########

1. "this" keyword is a special variable that is created for every execution context (every function).
	It takes the value of (points to) the "owner" of the function in which the this keyword is used.

2. "this" keyword is NOT static. It depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned
	when the function is actually called.

3. Different ways a function is called:
	
	a. Object method call => this keyword points to the object that is calling the method (if it is not an arrow function).
	b. Simple function call => this = undefined (only in strict mode) otherwise points to window object
										in browser.
	c. Arrow functions => this keyword points to the this value of outer execution context. It does not get its own "this" object.
	d. Event listener => this keyword points to the DOM element the handler is attached to.

4. this keyword does not point to the function itself and also not its variable environment.

####### Modern Javascript development: Modules and Tooling ########

1. We don't write a big script file and send it to browser. Earlier it used to be like this but now its different.
   But today the big script is divided into modules and these modules can share data between them and make code
   more organised and maintainable.

2. We can add 3rd party modules like react, jquery etc using npm. npm is both the repository in which
   packages are present and can be downloaded.

3. After the development step, the project needs to go through a build process where one big final javascript file 
   is built. So that final file will be deployed to the webserver for production and basically it will be sent
   to the browsers in production.

4. Build process bundles all modules into 1 single file which is a complex process which can eliminate unused code
   and compress code as well. This is an important step for 2 reasons:
		=> Older browsers don't support modules
		=> Performance is improved to send less files to the browser by bundling.

5. After bundling, transfiling and polyfilling happens which converts all modern javascript syntax and features
   back to old ES5 syntax so that even older browsers can understand our code without breaking. This is done using
   Babel. After these 2 steps we are ready to deploy the final bundle to a server for production.

6. The build process is done by build tools like webpack, parcel etc. Webpack is more popular one but it is
   hard to use. Parcel is a zero configuration bundler which simply works out of the box.

####### ES6 Modules Overview #######

1. Modules are stored in file, exactly 1 module per file.

2. There are 2 types of files:
 => ES6 module
 => normal script files

3. Differences between ES6 module and normal script files:

=> Top-level variables:
 - In ES6 modules, top level variables are scoped to the module.
 - In script files, top level variables are global.

=> Default mode:
	- In ES6 modules, the javascript is compiled in strict mode. 
	- In script files, the javascript is compiled in "sloppy" mode.

=> Top-level this:
	- In ES6 modules, the this keyword is undefined.
	- In script files, the this keyword points to window object.

=> Imports and Exports:
	- In ES6 modules, imports and exports are possible. Also, the imports are hoisted in the module so
	  they will be moved to the top. To link ES6 module to a HTML file, we need to use type="module" 
	  attribute in script tag like this: <script type="module" />.
	- In script files, imports and exports are impossible.

=> File downloading:
	- In ES6 modules, the module file is downloaded in an async way whether it is imported or
	  it is a script tag of type module.
	- In script files, the file is dowloaded in a synchronous way unless async or defer attributes
	  are used in the script tag.

###### How ES6 modules are imported ######

1. In the first step, parsing of code starts with hoisting all top level variables and imports.
During parsing the code is only read and not executed. All the modules are imported before the 
execution starts.

2. Importing of modules happen in a synchronous way to bundle and eliminate dead code.
Importing can happen only at top level as they get known during the parsing stage and help
with bundling and dead code elimination.

3. After parsing is completed the parsed module is downloaded in an asynchronous way from the
server. Only the importing is done in a synchronous way.

4. During the importing stage, the imported variable is just a pointer to the variable or function.

##### Top level await (ES2022) #####

1. Starting from ES2022 version, await can be used at top level outside of asynchronous functions atleast
in ES6 modules and not in script files.

2. But top level await request are blocking code so they are executed synchronously.

Example:

const getLastPost =  async function () {
	// some async code
};

const lastPost = await getLastPost();

3. If 1 module imports another module which is using top level await then the importing module
waits for the top level await to finish executing the blocking code.

##### Other module systems #####

1. There are 2 more module systems other than ES6 modules and module pattern:
	=> AMD modules
	=> CommonJS modules

2. CommonJS modules:
 => Many npm modules are using CommonJS modules because Node.js uses CommonJS as ES6
    modules were recently implemented.

3. We cannot use commonJS modules without a module bundler so we have to install a package
   in its ES6 modules version.

4. In commonJS modules, we export functions like the following:

// Export
exports.addToCart = function (project, quality) {
	// logic...
}

OR

module.exports = function (product, quality) {
	// logic...
}

// Import
const { addToCart } = require('./shoppingCart.js');
